Track JSON with Git LFS

Only works if the large blob never reached the remote (your push was rejected, so you’re fine). Re-commit the file as an LFS pointer and push again.

# 1) Undo the last commit if it added the big JSON
#    (keeps your changes in the working tree)
git reset --mixed HEAD~1

# 2) Install & init LFS (one-time on your machine)
git lfs install

# 3) Track the large file (specific path is better than *.json)
git lfs track "understanding_lvis/mini_lvis_balanced/lvis_mini_balanced_25k_fixed.json"
git add .gitattributes

# 4) Re-add the file so it becomes an LFS pointer
git add "understanding_lvis/mini_lvis_balanced/lvis_mini_balanced_25k_fixed.json"

# 5) Commit and push
git commit -m "Track mini LVIS JSON with Git LFS"
git push origin main


Tip: prefer tracking just that path instead of all *.json, so you don’t put normal JSONs into LFS.
